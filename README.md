# Schedule Generator

This is a schedule generator written in Javascript using the Meteor.js
framework. I built this because I wanted to be able to create schedules for the
things I want to get done regularly. I also wanted to try out the Meteor.js
framework.

## TODO

* Export to google calendar/some universal calendar format
* Check for conflicting times when adding a task
* Improve the naive scheduling algorithm
* Make the site more pretty
